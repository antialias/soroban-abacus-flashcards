# üöÇ STEAM TRAIN REBUILD REMINDER

**‚ö†Ô∏è ALWAYS CHECK THIS BEFORE STARTING WORK ON TRAIN FEATURES:**

## What Happened:

- Git reset destroyed all enhanced steam train features
- Features were in commits 57ef456 and bf65d45 but got lost
- User is rightfully pissed about losing working features

## What To Do:

1. **ALWAYS reference `/Users/antialias/projects/soroban-abacus-flashcards/REBUILD_CHECKLIST.md`**
2. **Rebuild features systematically, one at a time**
3. **Commit each feature individually**
4. **Test each feature before moving to next**
5. **Never do destructive git operations without user approval**

## Current Status:

- On commit 84334f9 (only has timer bar hidden)
- Need to rebuild ALL enhanced train features
- Priority: Fix question generation first, then visual features

## Key Lesson:

- When user asks to "hide timer bar" ‚Üí just hide the timer bar
- Don't break the entire question generation system
- Don't do git resets that lose working features
- Always keep this checklist updated

**üî• CHECK THE REBUILD CHECKLIST BEFORE EVERY TRAIN-RELATED TASK**
