# 🚂 STEAM TRAIN FEATURES REBUILD CHECKLIST

**⚠️ CRITICAL: All these features were lost due to git reset fuckup. Need to rebuild systematically.**

## 💥 FEATURES TO REBUILD:

### **🚂 Visual Train Features:**

- [ ] **Realistic railroad tracks** with ties and dual rails
- [ ] **Dynamically generated curved train tracks** (not basic SVG paths)
- [ ] **Half-circle pressure gauge** with narrow isosceles triangle indicator
- [ ] **Enhanced train locomotive visuals**
- [ ] **Steam effects and animations**

### **🎈 Floating Math Display System:**

- [ ] **Floating speech bubble** that follows the train along the track
- [ ] **Display switching logic** (static → floating after delay)
- [ ] **Proper positioning** that keeps math problems above the moving train

### **⚡ Enhanced Pressure/Momentum System:**

- [ ] **Pressure system** where wrong answers drop momentum to zero
- [ ] **Coal spilling animations** and sound effects for wrong answers
- [ ] **Momentum-based train physics** with dramatic consequences

### **🔊 Complete Audio System:**

- [ ] **Realistic train chuffing sounds** that vary with momentum
- [ ] **Steam train whistles** for celebrations and milestones
- [ ] **Coal spilling sound effects** with multiple chunks/scatter
- [ ] **Momentum-based audio** that changes with train speed

### **🎨 Animations & Effects:**

- [ ] **Coal shoveling animations** (for correct answers)
- [ ] **Coal spilling animations** (for wrong answers)
- [ ] **Steam particle effects**
- [ ] **Train movement along curved paths**

### **🎮 Game Mechanics:**

- [x] **Timer hidden** for train variant only ✅ (already working)
- [x] **Question generation system** ✅ (confirmed working - no rebuild needed)
- [ ] **Proper game state management**

## 📋 REBUILD PROGRESS TRACKING:

### Completed Features:

- (none yet - starting from scratch)

### In Progress:

- (mark items when started)

### Next Priority:

- Fix question generation system first (so game actually works)
- Then build visual features systematically

**🔥 REMINDER: Reference this checklist throughout the rebuild process to ensure no features are forgotten again.**

**💡 TIP: Check off items as completed and commit each feature individually to prevent future data loss.**
