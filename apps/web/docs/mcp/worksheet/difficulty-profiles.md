# Difficulty Profiles

Difficulty profiles are pre-configured combinations of regrouping frequency and scaffolding levels that follow pedagogical best practices.

## The Six Profiles

### 1. Beginner

**Focus:** Learning worksheet structure, no regrouping yet.

| Setting     | Value         |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| Regrouping  | 0%            |
| Scaffolding | Full (always) |

**Use when:** Student is new to multi-digit arithmetic or needs to learn place value alignment.

**Example problems:** 23 + 14, 45 + 32 (no carrying required)

---

### 2. Early Learner

**Focus:** Introducing regrouping concept with full support.

| Setting     | Value                        |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| Regrouping  | 25%                          |
| Scaffolding | Conditional (whenRegrouping) |

**Use when:** Student understands place value, ready to encounter carrying/borrowing.

**Key feature:** Scaffolding appears only when the problem requires it, teaching students to recognize when regrouping is needed.

---

### 3. Practice

**Focus:** Master regrouping mechanics WITH scaffolding support.

| Setting     | Value                        |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| Regrouping  | 75%                          |
| Scaffolding | High (always/whenRegrouping) |

**Use when:** Student understands regrouping but needs repetition to build fluency.

**Critical insight:** This is where students should spend significant time. They need to master the skill with support BEFORE removing the training wheels.

---

### 4. Intermediate

**Focus:** Begin removing scaffolding while maintaining regrouping frequency.

| Setting     | Value                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| Regrouping  | 75%                            |
| Scaffolding | Reduced (whenMultipleRegroups) |

**Use when:** Student is accurate with regrouping, ready for more independence.

**Transition:** Same problem difficulty, less visual support.

---

### 5. Advanced

**Focus:** Complex problems with minimal support.

| Setting     | Value                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| Regrouping  | 90%                            |
| Scaffolding | Minimal (when3PlusDigits only) |

**Use when:** Student demonstrates consistent accuracy, building speed.

---

### 6. Expert

**Focus:** Full independence, preparing for mental math.

| Setting     | Value |
| ----------- | ----- |
| Regrouping  | 90%   |
| Scaffolding | None  |

**Use when:** Student is ready for standardized test format or transitioning to mental arithmetic.

Beginner → Early Learner → Practice → Intermediate → Advanced → Expert

```

### The "Practice" Plateau

Many curricula rush through the practice phase. Students who haven't mastered regrouping WITH scaffolding will struggle when it's removed.

**Signs a student isn't ready to progress:**

- Accuracy drops below 85%
- Frequently forgets to carry/borrow
- Needs to count on fingers for single-digit sums
- Avoids problems or shows frustration

**Signs a student is ready to progress:**

- Consistent 90%+ accuracy
- Smooth, confident work
- Can explain their process
- Completes problems without pausing

## Choosing a Profile for a Student

Ask these questions:

1. **Can they align multi-digit numbers correctly?**
   - No → Beginner
   - Yes → Continue

2. **Have they encountered regrouping?**
   - No → Early Learner
   - Yes → Continue

3. **Are they accurate (85%+) with regrouping problems WITH scaffolding?**
   - No → Practice
   - Yes → Continue

4. **Are they accurate (85%+) without scaffolding?**
   - No → Intermediate
   - Yes → Continue

5. **Are they fast and confident with complex problems?**
   - No → Advanced
   - Yes → Expert

## Custom Configurations

If profiles don't fit, you can customize:

- Use Practice regrouping (75%) with Intermediate scaffolding
- Increase regrouping to 100% for targeted practice
- Keep scaffolding longer for students with working memory challenges

The profiles are starting points, not rigid rules.
