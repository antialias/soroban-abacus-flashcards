# Beyond Easy and Hard: A 2D Approach to Worksheet Difficulty

Most educational software treats difficulty as a one-dimensional slider: easy → medium → hard. But anyone who's taught students knows that difficulty is more nuanced than that.

We've built a new approach for our addition worksheet generator that treats difficulty as **two independent dimensions**: problem complexity (Challenge) and instructional support (Support). And critically, we constrain the combinations to only those that are pedagogically valid.

Here's why this matters and how it works.

## The Problem with 1D Difficulty

Imagine you're a teacher working with two students:

**Student A**: Ready for harder problems with multi-digit regrouping, but still benefits from visual aids like ten-frames and place value colors.

**Student B**: Comfortable working independently without scaffolding, but struggles with complex regrouping and needs simpler problems.

With a traditional "easy/medium/hard" system, you're stuck:

- Setting difficulty to "hard" gives Student A complex problems... but removes all the visual support they still need
- Setting it to "easy" gives Student B the scaffolding-free experience they want... but the problems are too simple

**You can't express "hard problems with visual aids" or "easy problems without scaffolding"** because difficulty conflates two completely different things: the intrinsic complexity of the problem and the amount of instructional support provided.

## Our Solution: Challenge × Support

We split difficulty into two independent dimensions:

### Challenge Axis (Regrouping Complexity)

How complex is the problem itself?

- **Low**: Simple addition, no carrying (23 + 15)
- **Medium**: Some regrouping in ones or tens place (47 + 38)
- **High**: Frequent regrouping across multiple place values (587 + 798)

This is **intrinsic cognitive load** — the inherent difficulty of the problem regardless of how it's presented.

### Support Axis (Scaffolding Level)

How much instructional support is shown?

- **High support**: Carry boxes, answer boxes, place value colors, ten-frames
- **Medium support**: Carry boxes when needed, colors for larger numbers
- **Low support**: Minimal or no scaffolding, student works independently

This is **extraneous cognitive load** — the mental effort required by how the problem is presented and supported.

## But Here's the Crucial Part: Constraints

Not all combinations of Challenge and Support are pedagogically valid.

**High challenge + High support** doesn't work well. If you're giving students complex multi-digit regrouping problems but showing them every step with maximum scaffolding, you're preventing them from developing problem-solving strategies. They're just following the scaffolds, not thinking.

**Low challenge + Low support** is pointless practice. If the problems are trivially simple and you're not providing any instructional structure, students aren't learning anything new.

So we constrain the space to a **diagonal band** of valid combinations:

```
                    Support (Scaffolding) →
                Low         Medium        High
Challenge  High   ✓            ✓           ✗
(Regrouping)      ✓            ✓           ✓
          Medium  ✗            ✓           ✓
                  ✗            ✗           ✓
          Low     ✗            ✓           ✓
```

**As challenge increases, support must decrease** (and vice versa). This encodes a fundamental pedagogical principle: students learning new concepts need support, but as they master the concept, support should fade.

### Visual Examples

Here's what this looks like in practice. Below are actual worksheet examples showing **the same problem complexity** (problems with moderate regrouping) but with **different levels of scaffolding**:

#### Full Scaffolding

![Worksheet with full scaffolding](/blog/difficulty-examples/full-scaffolding.svg)
_Maximum visual support: carry boxes always shown, answer boxes, place value colors, and ten-frames for every step._

#### Medium Scaffolding

![Worksheet with medium scaffolding](/blog/difficulty-examples/medium-scaffolding.svg)
_Strategic support: carry boxes appear when regrouping occurs, answer boxes provided, place value colors for 3+ digit numbers._

#### Minimal Scaffolding

![Worksheet with minimal scaffolding](/blog/difficulty-examples/minimal-scaffolding.svg)
_Minimal scaffolding: carry boxes only for complex problems with multiple regroups, no answer boxes or colors._

#### No Scaffolding

![Worksheet with no scaffolding](/blog/difficulty-examples/no-scaffolding.svg)
_Zero scaffolding: students work completely independently with no visual aids._

Notice how the **problem complexity stays constant** (all use the same regrouping probability), but the **scaffolding progressively fades**. This demonstrates how support can be adjusted independently from problem difficulty, allowing teachers to precisely target their students' needs.

## Theoretical Foundation

This isn't just intuition — it maps to established learning theory:

**Zone of Proximal Development** (Vygotsky): The diagonal band represents the learnable space. Too easy = already mastered. Too hard without support = beyond reach. The valid combinations are where learning happens.

**Cognitive Load Theory** (Sweller): Effective instruction balances intrinsic load (problem complexity) and extraneous load (instructional design). Our constraints prevent overload from either source.

**Scaffolding Fading** (Wood, Bruner, Ross): Temporary supports should be gradually removed as competence develops. The constraint band enforces this fading principle.

## How Teachers Use It

The UI provides three ways to adjust difficulty:

### 1. Default: "Make Harder" / "Make Easier"

The main buttons adjust **both dimensions** simultaneously, moving diagonally through the valid space toward appropriate preset levels (Beginner → Early Learner → Intermediate → Advanced → Expert).

This is the simple, no-thought-required option that works for most cases.

### 2. Challenge-Only Adjustment

Click the dropdown arrow, select "More challenge" or "Less challenge".

This moves **horizontally** — changing problem complexity while maintaining current scaffolding level.

**Use case**: Student A above. They're ready for harder problems but still need the visual aids. Click "More challenge" to increase regrouping while keeping support constant.

### 3. Support-Only Adjustment

Click the dropdown arrow, select "More support" or "Less support".

This moves **vertically** — changing scaffolding level while maintaining current problem complexity.

**Use case**: Student B above. They understand the concepts and don't need the training wheels anymore. Click "Less support" to remove scaffolding while keeping problems at the same complexity.

## Implementation Details

Under the hood, we use a **hybrid discrete/continuous architecture**:

- **Discrete indices** for navigation: 19 regrouping levels (0-18), 13 scaffolding levels (0-12)
- **Continuous scores** for visualization: Calculated on-the-fly for the difficulty graph and preset detection
- **Constraint validation** at every step: The system auto-corrects invalid states

This gives us:

- Predictable, testable behavior (discrete states)
- Smooth visualization (continuous scores)
- Guaranteed pedagogical validity (constraint enforcement)

Each preset profile (Beginner/Intermediate/etc.) is a specific (challenge, support) coordinate in the valid space. The "Make Harder" button finds the nearest harder preset and navigates toward it, automatically adjusting both dimensions as needed.

## Try It Yourself

The system is live at **[abaci.one/create/worksheets/addition](https://abaci.one/create/worksheets/addition)**.

Try these scenarios:

1. **Start at Beginner**, click "Make Harder" repeatedly → watch it move diagonally through the space
2. **Start at Intermediate**, use the dropdown to select "More challenge" only → see problems get harder while keeping visual aids
3. **Start at Early Learner**, use "Less support" → watch scaffolding disappear while problem complexity stays constant
4. **Click on the 2D graph** (the orange debug visualization) → jump directly to any valid difficulty point

The graph shows:

- Gray diagonal band: Valid pedagogical combinations
- Colored dots: Preset profiles (B=Beginner, I=Intermediate, etc.)
- Blue cross: Your current position
- Click anywhere to jump there (system auto-corrects to nearest valid point)

## Why This Matters

Traditional 1D difficulty forces teachers into a one-size-fits-all progression. Every student moves along the same path from "easy" to "hard", regardless of their individual needs.

**Our 2D constrained space enables precise differentiation**:

- Students who grasp concepts quickly can reduce support while maintaining challenge
- Students who need more time get continued support while still progressing to harder problems
- Students can move through the space at different angles, not just along a single path

And because the constraints encode pedagogical principles, teachers can't accidentally create nonsensical combinations. The system guides them toward valid instructional choices.

## What's Next

This is currently implemented for addition worksheets, but the approach generalizes:

- Subtraction, multiplication, division
- Other domains entirely (reading comprehension, programming exercises, etc.)
- Any learning task where you can separate intrinsic difficulty from instructional support

## Feedback Welcome

We'd love to hear from educators using this system:

- Does the 2D model match your mental model of difficulty?
- Are the dimension-specific controls useful?
- What other domains would benefit from this approach?
