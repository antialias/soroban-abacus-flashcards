In Woolsthorpe nights of candle-glow,
He watched the apple fall just so—
A whisper of ẋ murmured low,
A hint of what he'd one day know.

He carved the world in curves of light,
Bent stars with math he birthed outright;
But markets?—aye, a different fight,
Whose tides he failed to fluxion right.

For coin obeys no cosmic plot,
It drifts where fevered humors rot;
He'd trace a comet's path on the spot—
Yet never guessed his stocks were naught.

He could have tamed each rising bar,
Mapped fortunes by <span style="position: relative;">x<span style="position: absolute; top: -0.25em; left: 0; right: 0; text-align: center;">̄</span></span> afar,
And steered his purse like some bright star—
Not wrecked upon a South Sea scar.

But genius trips where mortals trot,
And even Newton, spared no blot,
Might've saved his gold—had he used ẋ
To see the crash begot.

And thus his wealth slipped through the sieve,
With no derivative to give;
He mastered laws by which stars live,
But found the Market... negative.
