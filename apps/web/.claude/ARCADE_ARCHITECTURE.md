# Arcade Game Architecture

## Overview

The arcade system supports two distinct game modes that must remain completely isolated from each other:

1. **Local Play** - Games without network synchronization (can be single-player OR local multiplayer)
2. **Room-Based Play** - Networked games with real-time synchronization across room members

## Core Terminology

Following `docs/terminology-user-player-room.md`:

- **USER** - Identity (guest or authenticated account), retrieved via `useViewerId()`, one per browser/account
- **PLAYER** - Game avatar/profile (e.g., "Alice üëß", "Bob üë¶"), stored in `players` table
- **PLAYER ROSTER** - All PLAYERS belonging to a USER (can have many)
- **ACTIVE PLAYERS** - PLAYERS where `isActive = true` - these are the ones that actually participate in games
- **ROOM MEMBER** - A USER's participation in a multiplayer room (tracked in `room_members` table)
- **SPECTATOR** - A room member who watches another player's game without participating (see Spectator Mode section)

**Important:** A USER can have many PLAYERS in their roster, but only the ACTIVE PLAYERS (where `isActive = true`) participate in games. This enables "hot-potato" style local multiplayer where multiple people share the same device. This is LOCAL play (not networked), even though multiple PLAYERS participate.

In arcade sessions:

- `arcade_sessions.userId` - The USER who owns the session
- `arcade_sessions.activePlayers` - Array of PLAYER IDs (only active players with `isActive = true`)
- `arcade_sessions.roomId` - If present, the room ID for networked play (references `arcade_rooms.id`)

## Critical Architectural Requirements

### 1. Game Synchronization Modes

The arcade system supports three synchronization patterns:

#### Local Play (No Network Sync)
**Route**: Custom route or dedicated local page
**Use Case**: Practice, offline play, or games that should never be visible to others

- MUST NOT sync game state across the network
- MUST NOT use room data, even if the USER is currently a member of an active room
- MUST pass `roomId: undefined` to `useArcadeSession`
- Game state lives only in the current browser tab/session
- CAN have multiple ACTIVE PLAYERS from the same USER (local multiplayer / hot-potato)
- State is NOT shared across the network, only within the browser session

#### Room-Based with Spectator Mode (RECOMMENDED PATTERN)
**Route**: `/arcade/room` (or use room context anywhere)
**Use Case**: Most arcade games - enables spectating even for single-player games

- SYNCS game state across all room members via network
- Uses the USER's current active room (`roomId: roomData?.id`)
- Coordinates moves via server WebSocket
- Game state is shared across all ACTIVE PLAYERS from all USERS in the room
- **Non-playing room members become SPECTATORS** (see Spectator Mode section)
- When a PLAYER makes a move, all room members see it in real-time (players + spectators)
- CAN have multiple ACTIVE PLAYERS per USER (networked + local multiplayer combined)

**‚úÖ This is the PREFERRED pattern** - even for single-player games like Card Sorting, because:
- Enables spectator mode automatically
- Creates social experience ("watch me solve this!")
- No extra code needed
- Works seamlessly with multiplayer games too

#### Pure Multiplayer (Room-Only)
**Route**: `/arcade/room` with validation
**Use Case**: Games that REQUIRE multiple players (e.g., competitive battles)

- Same as Room-Based with Spectator Mode
- Plus: Validates minimum player count before starting
- Plus: May prevent game start if `activePlayers.length < minPlayers`

### 2. Room ID Usage Rules

```typescript
// ‚ùå WRONG: Always checking for room data
const { roomData } = useRoomData();
useArcadeSession({ roomId: roomData?.id }) < // This causes the bug!
  // ‚úÖ CORRECT: Explicit mode control via separate providers
  LocalMemoryPairsProvider >
  {
    /* Never passes roomId */
  } <
  RoomMemoryPairsProvider >
  {
    /* Always passes roomId */
  };
```

**Key principle:** The presence of a `roomId` parameter in `useArcadeSession` determines synchronization behavior:

- `roomId` present ‚Üí room-wide network sync enabled (room-based play)
- `roomId` undefined ‚Üí local play only (no network sync)

### 3. Composition Over Flags (PREFERRED APPROACH)

**‚úÖ Option 1: Separate Providers (CLEAREST - USE THIS)**

Create two distinct provider components:

```typescript
// context/LocalMemoryPairsProvider.tsx
export function LocalMemoryPairsProvider({ children }) {
  const { data: viewerId } = useViewerId();
  const { activePlayers } = useGameMode(); // Gets active players (isActive = true)
  // NEVER fetch room data for local play

  const { state, sendMove } = useArcadeSession<MemoryPairsState>({
    userId: viewerId || "",
    roomId: undefined, // Explicitly undefined - no network sync
    initialState,
    applyMove: applyMoveOptimistically,
  });

  // ... rest of provider logic
  // Note: activePlayers contains only PLAYERS with isActive = true
}

// context/RoomMemoryPairsProvider.tsx
export function RoomMemoryPairsProvider({ children }) {
  const { data: viewerId } = useViewerId();
  const { roomData } = useRoomData(); // OK to fetch for room-based play
  const { activePlayers } = useGameMode(); // Gets active players (isActive = true)

  const { state, sendMove } = useArcadeSession<MemoryPairsState>({
    userId: viewerId || "",
    roomId: roomData?.id, // Pass roomId for network sync
    initialState,
    applyMove: applyMoveOptimistically,
  });

  // ... rest of provider logic
}
```

Then use them explicitly:

```typescript
// /arcade/matching/page.tsx (Local Play)
export default function MatchingPage() {
  return (
    <ArcadeGuardedPage>
      <LocalMemoryPairsProvider>
        <MemoryPairsGame />
      </LocalMemoryPairsProvider>
    </ArcadeGuardedPage>
  )
}

// /arcade/room/page.tsx (Room-Based Play)
export default function RoomPage() {
  // ... room validation logic
  if (roomData.gameName === 'matching') {
    return (
      <RoomMemoryPairsProvider>
        <MemoryPairsGame />
      </RoomMemoryPairsProvider>
    )
  }
}
```

**Benefits of separate providers:**

- Compile-time safety - impossible to mix modes
- Clear intent - any developer can see which mode at a glance
- No runtime conditionals needed
- Easier to test - each provider tests separately

**‚ùå Avoid:** Runtime flag checking scattered throughout code

```typescript
// Anti-pattern: Too many conditionals
if (isRoomBased) { ... } else { ... }
```

### 4. How Synchronization Works

#### Local Play Flow

```
USER Action ‚Üí useArcadeSession (roomId: undefined)
           ‚Üí WebSocket emit('join-arcade-session', { userId })
           ‚Üí Server creates isolated session for userId
           ‚Üí Session key = userId
           ‚Üí session.activePlayers = USER's active player IDs (isActive = true)
           ‚Üí State changes only affect this USER's browser tabs

Note: Multiple ACTIVE PLAYERS from same USER can participate (local multiplayer),
      but state is NEVER synced across network
```

#### Room-Based Play Flow

```
USER Action (on behalf of PLAYER)
         ‚Üí useArcadeSession (roomId: 'room_xyz')
         ‚Üí WebSocket emit('join-arcade-session', { userId, roomId })
         ‚Üí Server creates/joins shared session for roomId
         ‚Üí session.activePlayers = ALL active players from ALL room members
         ‚Üí Socket joins TWO rooms: `arcade:${userId}` AND `game:${roomId}`
         ‚Üí PLAYER makes move
         ‚Üí Server validates PLAYER ownership (is this PLAYER owned by this USER?)
         ‚Üí State changes broadcast to:
            - arcade:${userId} - All tabs of this USER (for optimistic reconciliation)
            - game:${roomId} - All USERS in the room (for network sync)

Note: Each USER can still have multiple ACTIVE PLAYERS (local + networked multiplayer)
```

The server-side logic uses `roomId` to determine session scope:

- No `roomId`: Session key = `userId` (isolated to USER's browser)
- With `roomId`: Session key = `roomId` (shared across all room members)

See `docs/MULTIPLAYER_SYNC_ARCHITECTURE.md` for detailed socket room mechanics.

### 5. USER vs PLAYER in Game Logic

**Important distinction:**

- **Session ownership**: Tracked by USER ID (`useViewerId()`)
- **Player roster**: All PLAYERS for a USER (can be many)
- **Active players**: PLAYERS with `isActive = true` (these join the game)
- **Game actions**: Performed by PLAYER ID (from `players` table)
- **Move validation**: Server checks that PLAYER ID belongs to the requesting USER
- **Local multiplayer**: One USER with multiple ACTIVE PLAYERS (hot-potato style, same device)
- **Networked multiplayer**: Multiple USERS, each with their own ACTIVE PLAYERS, in a room

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Correct: USER owns session, ACTIVE PLAYERS participate
const { data: viewerId } = useViewerId(); // USER ID
const { activePlayers } = useGameMode(); // ACTIVE PLAYER IDs (isActive = true)

// activePlayers might be [player_001, player_002]
// even though USER has 5 total PLAYERS in their roster

const { state, sendMove } = useArcadeSession({
  userId: viewerId, // Session owned by USER
  roomId: undefined, // Local play (or roomData?.id for room-based)
  // ...
});

// When PLAYER flips card:
sendMove({
  type: "FLIP_CARD",
  playerId: currentPlayerId, // PLAYER ID from activePlayers
  data: { cardId: "..." },
});
```

**Example Scenarios:**

1. **Single-player local game:**
   - USER: "guest_abc"
   - Player roster: ["player_001" (active), "player_002" (inactive), "player_003" (inactive)]
   - Active PLAYERS in game: ["player_001"]
   - Mode: Local play (no roomId)

2. **Local multiplayer (hot-potato):**
   - USER: "guest_abc"
   - Player roster: ["player_001" (active), "player_002" (active), "player_003" (active), "player_004" (inactive)]
   - Active PLAYERS in game: ["player_001", "player_002", "player_003"] (3 kids sharing device)
   - Mode: Local play (no roomId)
   - Game rotates turns between the 3 active PLAYERS, but NO network sync

3. **Room-based networked play:**
   - USER A: "guest_abc"
     - Player roster: 5 total PLAYERS
     - Active PLAYERS: ["player_001", "player_002"]
   - USER B: "guest_def"
     - Player roster: 3 total PLAYERS
     - Active PLAYERS: ["player_003"]
   - Mode: Room-based play (roomId: "room_xyz")
   - Total PLAYERS in game: 3 (player_001, player_002, player_003)
   - All 3 synced across network

4. **Room-based + local multiplayer combined:**
   - USER A: "guest_abc" with 3 active PLAYERS (3 kids at Device A)
   - USER B: "guest_def" with 2 active PLAYERS (2 kids at Device B)
   - Mode: Room-based play (roomId: "room_xyz")
   - 5 total active PLAYERS across 2 devices, all synced over network

5. **Single-player game with spectators (Card Sorting):**
   - USER A: "guest_abc"
     - Active PLAYERS: ["player_001"]
     - Playing Card Sorting Challenge
   - USER B: "guest_def"
     - Active PLAYERS: [] (none selected)
     - Spectating USER A's game
   - USER C: "guest_ghi"
     - Active PLAYERS: ["player_005"]
     - Spectating USER A's game (could play after USER A finishes)
   - Mode: Room-based play (roomId: "room_xyz")
   - All room members see USER A's card placements in real-time
   - Spectators cannot interact with the game state

## Spectator Mode

### Overview

Spectator mode is automatically enabled when using room-based sync (`roomId: roomData?.id`). Any room member who is not actively playing becomes a spectator and can watch the game in real-time.

**Key Benefits**:
- Creates social/collaborative experience even for single-player games
- "Watch me solve this!" engagement
- Learning by observation
- Cheering/coaching opportunity
- No extra implementation needed

### How It Works

1. **Automatic Role Assignment**:
   - Room members with active PLAYERs in the game ‚Üí **Players**
   - Room members without active PLAYERs in the game ‚Üí **Spectators**

2. **State Synchronization**:
   - All game state updates broadcast to entire room via `game:${roomId}` socket room
   - Spectators receive same state updates as players
   - Spectators see game in real-time as it happens

3. **Interaction Control**:
   - Players can make moves (send move actions)
   - Spectators can only observe (no move actions permitted)
   - Server validates PLAYER ownership before accepting moves

### Implementation Pattern

**Provider** (Room-Based with Spectator Support):

```typescript
export function CardSortingProvider({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  const { data: viewerId } = useViewerId()
  const { roomData } = useRoomData()  // ‚úÖ Fetch room data
  const { activePlayers, players } = useGameMode()

  // Find local player (if any)
  const localPlayerId = useMemo(() => {
    return Array.from(activePlayers).find((id) => {
      const player = players.get(id)
      return player?.isLocal !== false
    })
  }, [activePlayers, players])

  const { state, sendMove, exitSession } = useArcadeSession<CardSortingState>({
    userId: viewerId || '',
    roomId: roomData?.id,  // ‚úÖ Enable spectator mode
    initialState,
    applyMove: applyMoveOptimistically,
  })

  // Actions check if local player exists before allowing moves
  const startGame = useCallback(() => {
    if (!localPlayerId) {
      console.warn('[CardSorting] No local player - spectating only')
      return  // ‚úÖ Spectators cannot start game
    }
    sendMove({ type: 'START_GAME', playerId: localPlayerId, ... })
  }, [localPlayerId, sendMove])

  // ... rest of provider
}
```

**Key Implementation Points**:
- Always check `if (!localPlayerId)` before allowing moves
- Return early or show "Spectating..." message
- Don't throw errors - spectating is a valid state
- UI should indicate spectator vs player role

### UI/UX Considerations

#### 1. Spectator Indicators

Show visual feedback when user is spectating:

```typescript
{!localPlayerId && state.gamePhase === 'playing' && (
  <div className={spectatorBannerStyles}>
    üëÄ Spectating {state.playerMetadata.name}'s game
  </div>
)}
```

#### 2. Disabled Controls

Disable interactive elements for spectators:

```typescript
<button
  onClick={placeCard}
  disabled={!localPlayerId}  // Spectators can't interact
  className={css({
    opacity: !localPlayerId ? 0.5 : 1,
    cursor: !localPlayerId ? 'not-allowed' : 'pointer',
  })}
>
  Place Card
</button>
```

#### 3. Join Prompt

For games that support multiple players, show "Join Game" option:

```typescript
{!localPlayerId && state.gamePhase === 'setup' && (
  <button onClick={selectPlayerAndJoin}>
    Join as Player
  </button>
)}
```

#### 4. Real-Time Updates

Ensure spectators see smooth updates:
- Use optimistic UI updates (same as players)
- Show animations for state changes
- Display current player's moves as they happen

### When to Use Spectator Mode

**‚úÖ Use Spectator Mode (room-based sync) For**:
- Single-player puzzle games (Card Sorting, Sudoku, etc.)
- Turn-based competitive games (Matching Pairs Battle)
- Cooperative games (Memory Lightning)
- Any game where watching is educational/entertaining
- Social/family game nights
- Classroom settings (teacher demonstrates, students watch)

**‚ùå Avoid Spectator Mode (use local-only) For**:
- Private practice sessions
- Timed competitive games where watching gives unfair advantage
- Games with personal/sensitive content
- Offline/no-network scenarios
- Performance-critical games (reduce network overhead)

### Example Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Family Game Night - Card Sorting

```
Room: "Smith Family Game Night"

USER A (Dad): Playing Card Sorting
  - Active PLAYER: "Dad üë®"
  - State: Placing cards, 6/8 complete
  - Can interact with game

USER B (Mom): Spectating
  - Active PLAYERS: [] (none selected)
  - State: Sees Dad's card placements in real-time
  - Cannot place cards
  - Can cheer and help

USER C (Kid): Spectating
  - Active PLAYER: "Emma üëß" (selected but not in this game)
  - State: Watching to learn strategy
  - Will play next round

Flow:
1. Dad starts Card Sorting
2. Mom and Kid see setup phase
3. Dad places cards one by one
4. Mom/Kid see each placement instantly
5. Dad checks solution
6. Everyone sees the score together
7. Kid says "My turn!" and starts their own game
8. Dad and Mom become spectators
```

#### Scenario 2: Classroom - Memory Lightning

```
Room: "Ms. Johnson's 3rd Grade"

USER A (Teacher): Playing cooperatively with 2 students
  - Active PLAYERS: ["Teacher üë©‚Äçüè´", "Student 1 üë¶"]
  - State: Memorizing cards
  - Both can participate

USER B-F (5 other students): Spectating
  - Watching demonstration
  - Learning the rules
  - Will join next round

Flow:
1. Teacher demonstrates with 2 students
2. Other students watch and learn
3. Round ends
4. Teacher sets up new round
5. New students join as players
6. Previous players become spectators
```

### Server-Side Handling

The server must handle spectators correctly:

```typescript
// Validate move ownership
socket.on('game-move', ({ move, roomId }) => {
  const session = getSession(roomId)

  // Check if PLAYER making move is in the active players list
  if (!session.activePlayers.includes(move.playerId)) {
    return {
      error: 'PLAYER not in game - spectators cannot make moves'
    }
  }

  // Check if USER owns this PLAYER
  const playerOwner = getPlayerOwner(move.playerId)
  if (playerOwner !== socket.userId) {
    return {
      error: 'USER does not own this PLAYER'
    }
  }

  // Valid move - apply and broadcast
  const newState = validator.validateMove(session.state, move)
  io.to(`game:${roomId}`).emit('state-update', newState)  // ALL room members get update
})
```

**Key Server Logic**:
- Validate PLAYER is in `session.activePlayers`
- Validate USER owns PLAYER
- Broadcast to entire room (players + spectators)
- Spectators receive updates but cannot send moves

### Testing Spectator Mode

```typescript
describe('Spectator Mode', () => {
  it('should allow room members to spectate single-player games', () => {
    // Setup: USER A and USER B in same room
    // Action: USER A starts Card Sorting (single-player)
    // Assert: USER B receives game state updates
    // Assert: USER B cannot make moves
    // Assert: USER B sees USER A's card placements in real-time
  })

  it('should prevent spectators from making moves', () => {
    // Setup: USER A playing, USER B spectating
    // Action: USER B attempts to place a card
    // Assert: Server rejects move (PLAYER not in activePlayers)
    // Assert: Client UI disables controls for USER B
  })

  it('should show spectator indicator in UI', () => {
    // Setup: USER B spectating USER A's game
    // Assert: UI shows "Spectating [Player Name]" banner
    // Assert: Interactive controls are disabled
    // Assert: Game state is visible
  })

  it('should allow spectator to join next round', () => {
    // Setup: USER B spectating USER A's Card Sorting game
    // Action: USER A finishes game, returns to setup
    // Action: USER B starts new game
    // Assert: USER A becomes spectator
    // Assert: USER B becomes active player
  })
})
```

### Migration Path

**For existing games**:

If your game currently uses `roomId: roomData?.id`, it already supports spectator mode! You just need to:

1. ‚úÖ Check for `!localPlayerId` before allowing moves
2. ‚úÖ Add spectator UI indicators
3. ‚úÖ Disable controls when spectating
4. ‚úÖ Test spectator experience

**Example Fix**:

```typescript
// Before (will crash for spectators)
const placeCard = useCallback((cardId, position) => {
  sendMove({
    type: 'PLACE_CARD',
    playerId: localPlayerId,  // ‚ùå Will be undefined for spectators!
    ...
  })
}, [localPlayerId, sendMove])

// After (spectator-safe)
const placeCard = useCallback((cardId, position) => {
  if (!localPlayerId) {
    console.warn('Spectators cannot place cards')
    return  // ‚úÖ Spectators blocked from moving
  }
  sendMove({
    type: 'PLACE_CARD',
    playerId: localPlayerId,
    ...
  })
}, [localPlayerId, sendMove])
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Conditional Room Usage

```typescript
// ‚ùå BAD: Room sync leaks into local play
const { roomData } = useRoomData();
useArcadeSession({
  roomId: roomData?.id, // Local play will sync if USER is in a room!
});
```

### Mistake 2: Shared Components Without Mode Context

```typescript
// ‚ùå BAD: Same provider used for both modes
export default function LocalGamePage() {
  return <GameProvider><Game /></GameProvider>  // Which mode?
}
```

### Mistake 3: Confusing "multiplayer" with "networked"

```typescript
// ‚ùå BAD: Thinking multiple PLAYERS means room-based
if (activePlayers.length > 1) {
  // Must be room-based!  WRONG!
  // Could be local multiplayer (hot-potato style)
}

// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Check for roomId to determine network sync
const isNetworked = !!roomId;
const isLocalMultiplayer = activePlayers.length > 1 && !roomId;
```

### Mistake 4: Using all PLAYERS instead of only active ones

```typescript
// ‚ùå BAD: Including inactive players
const allPlayers = await db.query.players.findMany({
  where: eq(players.userId, userId),
});

// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Only active players join the game
const activePlayers = await db.query.players.findMany({
  where: and(eq(players.userId, userId), eq(players.isActive, true)),
});
```

### Mistake 5: Mixing USER ID and PLAYER ID

```typescript
// ‚ùå BAD: Using USER ID for game actions
sendMove({
  type: "FLIP_CARD",
  playerId: viewerId, // WRONG! viewerId is USER ID, not PLAYER ID
  data: { cardId: "..." },
});

// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Use PLAYER ID from game state
sendMove({
  type: "FLIP_CARD",
  playerId: state.currentPlayer, // PLAYER ID from activePlayers
  data: { cardId: "..." },
});
```

### Mistake 6: Server-Side Ambiguity

```typescript
// ‚ùå BAD: Server can't distinguish intent
socket.on("join-arcade-session", ({ userId, roomId }) => {
  // If roomId exists, did USER want local or room-based play?
  // This happens when provider always passes roomData?.id
});
```

## Testing Requirements

Tests MUST verify mode isolation:

### Local Play Tests

```typescript
it("should NOT sync state when USER is in a room but playing locally", async () => {
  // Setup: USER is a member of an active room
  // Action: USER navigates to /arcade/matching
  // Assert: Game state is NOT shared with other room members
  // Assert: Other room members' actions do NOT affect this game
});

it("should create isolated sessions for concurrent local games", () => {
  // Setup: Two USERS who are members of the same room
  // Action: Both navigate to /arcade/matching separately
  // Assert: Each has independent game state
  // Assert: USER A's moves do NOT appear in USER B's game
});

it("should support local multiplayer without network sync", () => {
  // Setup: USER with 3 active PLAYERS in roster (hot-potato style)
  // Action: USER plays at /arcade/matching with the 3 active PLAYERS
  // Assert: All 3 active PLAYERS participate in the same session
  // Assert: Inactive PLAYERS do NOT participate
  // Assert: State is NOT synced across network
  // Assert: Game rotates turns between active PLAYERS locally
});

it("should only include active players in game", () => {
  // Setup: USER has 5 PLAYERS in roster, but only 2 are active
  // Action: USER starts a local game
  // Assert: Only the 2 active PLAYERS are in activePlayers array
  // Assert: Inactive PLAYERS are not included
});

it("should sync across USER tabs but not across network", () => {
  // Setup: USER opens /arcade/matching in 2 browser tabs
  // Action: PLAYER makes move in Tab 1
  // Assert: Tab 2 sees the move (multi-tab sync)
  // Assert: Other USERS do NOT see the move (no network sync)
});
```

### Room-Based Play Tests

```typescript
it("should sync state across all room members", async () => {
  // Setup: Two USERS are members of the same room
  // Action: USER A's PLAYER flips card at /arcade/room
  // Assert: USER B sees the card flip in real-time
});

it("should sync across multiple active PLAYERS from multiple USERS", () => {
  // Setup: USER A has 2 active PLAYERS, USER B has 1 active PLAYER in same room
  // Action: USER A's PLAYER 1 makes move
  // Assert: All 3 PLAYERS see the move (networked)
});

it("should only include active players in room games", () => {
  // Setup: USER A (5 PLAYERS, 2 active), USER B (3 PLAYERS, 1 active) join room
  // Action: Game starts
  // Assert: session.activePlayers = [userA_player1, userA_player2, userB_player1]
  // Assert: Inactive PLAYERS are NOT included
});

it("should handle combined local + networked multiplayer", () => {
  // Setup: USER A (3 active PLAYERS), USER B (2 active PLAYERS) in same room
  // Action: Any PLAYER makes a move
  // Assert: All 5 active PLAYERS see the move across both devices
});

it("should fail gracefully when no room exists", () => {
  // Setup: USER is not a member of any room
  // Action: Navigate to /arcade/room
  // Assert: Shows "No active room" message
  // Assert: Does not create a session
});

it("should validate PLAYER ownership", async () => {
  // Setup: USER A in room with active PLAYER 'alice'
  // Action: USER A attempts move for PLAYER 'bob' (owned by USER B)
  // Assert: Server rejects the move
  // Assert: Error indicates unauthorized PLAYER
});
```

## Implementation Checklist

When adding a new game or modifying existing ones:

- [ ] Create separate `LocalGameProvider` and `RoomGameProvider` components
- [ ] Local provider never calls `useRoomData()`
- [ ] Local provider passes `roomId: undefined` to `useArcadeSession`
- [ ] Room provider calls `useRoomData()` and passes `roomId: roomData?.id`
- [ ] Both providers use `useGameMode()` to get active players
- [ ] Local play page uses `LocalGameProvider`
- [ ] `/arcade/room` page uses `RoomGameProvider`
- [ ] Game components correctly use PLAYER IDs (not USER IDs) for moves
- [ ] Game supports multiple active PLAYERS from same USER (local multiplayer)
- [ ] Inactive PLAYERS are never included in game sessions
- [ ] Tests verify mode isolation (local doesn't network sync, room-based does)
- [ ] Tests verify PLAYER ownership validation
- [ ] Tests verify only active PLAYERS participate
- [ ] Tests verify local multiplayer works (multiple active PLAYERS, one USER)
- [ ] Documentation updated if behavior changes

## Architecture Decision Records

### Why separate providers instead of auto-detect from route?

While we could detect mode based on the route (`/arcade/room` vs `/arcade/matching`), separate providers are clearer and prevent accidental misuse. Future developers can immediately see the intent, and the type system can enforce correctness.

### Why being in a room doesn't mean all games sync?

A USER being a room member does NOT mean all their games should network sync. They should be able to play local games while remaining in a room for future room-based sessions. Mode is determined by the page they're on, not their room membership status.

### Why not use a single shared provider with mode props?

We tried that. It led to the current bug where local play accidentally synced with rooms. Separate providers make the distinction compile-time safe rather than runtime conditional, and eliminate the possibility of accidentally passing `roomId` when we shouldn't.

### Why do we track sessions by USER but moves by PLAYER?

- **Sessions** are per-USER because each USER can have their own game session
- **Moves** are per-PLAYER because PLAYERS are the game avatars that score points
- **Only active PLAYERS** (isActive = true) participate in games
- This allows:
  - One USER with multiple active PLAYERS (local multiplayer / hot-potato)
  - Multiple USERS in one room (networked play)
  - Combined: Multiple USERS each with multiple active PLAYERS (local + networked)
  - Proper ownership validation (server checks USER owns PLAYER)
  - PLAYERS can be toggled active/inactive without deleting them

### Why use "local" vs "room-based" instead of "solo" vs "multiplayer"?

- **"Solo"** is misleading - a USER can have multiple active PLAYERS in local play (hot-potato style)
- **"Multiplayer"** is ambiguous - it could mean local multiplayer OR networked multiplayer
- **"Local play"** clearly means: no network sync (but can have multiple active PLAYERS)
- **"Room-based play"** clearly means: network sync across room members

## Version History

- **2025-10-09**: Initial documentation
  - Issue identified: Local play was syncing with rooms over network
  - Root cause: Same provider always fetched `roomData` and passed `roomId` to `useArcadeSession`
  - Solution: Separate providers for local vs room-based play
  - Terminology clarification: "local" vs "room-based" (not "solo" vs "multiplayer")
  - Active players: Only PLAYERS with `isActive = true` participate in games
