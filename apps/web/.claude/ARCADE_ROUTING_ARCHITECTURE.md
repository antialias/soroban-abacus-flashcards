# Arcade Routing Architecture - Complete Overview

## 1. Current /arcade Page

**File:** `/Users/antialias/projects/soroban-abacus-flashcards/apps/web/src/app/arcade/page.tsx` (lines 1-129)

**Purpose:** The main arcade landing page - displays the "Champion Arena"

**Key Components:**
- `ArcadeContent()` - Renders the main arcade interface
  - Uses `EnhancedChampionArena` component which contains `GameSelector`
  - The `GameSelector` displays all available games as cards
  - `GameSelector` includes both legacy games and registry games
  
**Current Flow:**
1. User navigates to `/arcade`
2. Page renders `FullscreenProvider` wrapper
3. Displays `PageWithNav` with title "üèüÔ∏è Champion Arena"
4. Content area shows `EnhancedChampionArena` ‚Üí `GameSelector`
5. `GameSelector` renders `GameCard` components for each game
6. When user clicks a game card, `GameCard` calls `router.push(config.url)`
7. For registry games, `config.url` is `/arcade/room?game={gameName}`
8. For legacy games, URL would be direct to their page

**State Management:**
- `GameModeContext` provides player selection (emoji, name, color)
- `PageWithNav` wraps content and provides mini-nav with:
  - Active player list
  - Add player button
  - Game mode indicator (single/battle/tournament)
  - Exit session handler

## 2. Current /arcade/room Page

**File:** `/Users/antialias/projects/soroban-abacus-flashcards/apps/web/src/app/arcade/room/page.tsx` (lines 1-359)

**Purpose:** "Magical place" that shows either a game OR the game chooser, driven by room state

**Three States:**

### State 1: Loading
- Shows "Loading room..." message
- Waits for `useRoomData()` hook to resolve

### State 2: Game Selection UI (when `!roomData.gameName`)
- Shows large game selection buttons
- User clicks to select a game
- Calls `setRoomGame()` mutation to save selection to room
- Invokes `handleGameSelect()` which:
  1. Checks if game exists in registry via `hasGame(gameType)`
  2. If registry game: calls `setRoomGame({roomId, gameName: gameType})`
  3. If legacy game: maps to internal name via `GAME_TYPE_TO_NAME`, then calls `setRoomGame()`
  4. Game selection is persisted to the room database

### State 3: Game Display (when `roomData.gameName` is set)
- Checks game registry first via `hasGame(roomData.gameName)`
- If registry game: 
  - Gets game definition via `getGame(roomData.gameName)`
  - Renders: `<Provider><GameComponent /></Provider>`
  - Provider and GameComponent come from game registry definition
- If legacy game:
  - Switch statement with TODO for individual games
  - Currently only shows "Game not yet supported"

**Key Hook:**
- `useRoomData()` - Fetches current room from API and subscribes to socket updates
  - Returns `roomData` with fields: `id`, `name`, `code`, `gameName`, `gameConfig`, `members`, `memberPlayers`
  - Also returns `isLoading` boolean

**Navigation Flow:**
1. User navigates to `/arcade`
2. `GameCard` onClick calls `router.push('/arcade/room?game={gameName}')`
3. User arrives at `/arcade/room`
4. If NOT in a room yet: Shows error with link back to `/arcade`
5. If in room but no game selected: Shows game selection UI
6. If game selected: Loads and displays game

## 3. The "Mini App Nav" - GameContextNav Component

**File:** `/Users/antialias/projects/soroban-abacus-flashcards/apps/web/src/components/nav/GameContextNav.tsx` (lines 1-372)

**What It Is:**
The "mini app nav" is actually a sophisticated component within the `PageWithNav` wrapper that intelligently shows different UI based on context:

**Components & Props:**
- `navTitle` - Current page title (e.g., "Champion Arena", "Choose Game", "Speed Complement Race")
- `navEmoji` - Icon emoji for current page
- `gameMode` - Computed from active player count: 'none' | 'single' | 'battle' | 'tournament'
- `activePlayers` - Array of selected players
- `inactivePlayers` - Array of available but unselected players
- `shouldEmphasize` - Boolean to emphasize player selection
- `showFullscreenSelection` - Boolean to show fullscreen mode for player selection
- `roomInfo` - Optional arcade room data (roomId, roomName, gameName, playerCount, joinCode)
- `networkPlayers` - Remote players from room members

**Three Display Modes:**

### Mode 1: Fullscreen Player Selection
- When `showFullscreenSelection === true`
- Displays:
  - Large title with emoji
  - Game mode indicator
  - Fullscreen player selection UI
  - Shows all inactive players for selection

### Mode 2: Solo Mode (NOT in room)
- When `roomInfo` is undefined
- Shows:
  - **Game Title Section** (left side):
    - `GameTitleMenu` with game title and emoji
    - Menu options: Setup, New Game, Quit
    - `GameModeIndicator`
  - **Player Section** (right side):
    - `ActivePlayersList` - shows selected players
    - `AddPlayerButton` - add more players

### Mode 3: Room Mode (IN a room)
- When `roomInfo` is defined
- Shows:
  - **Hidden:** Game title section (display: none)
  - **Room Info Pane** (left side):
    - `RoomInfo` component with room details
    - Game mode indicator with color/emoji
    - Room name, player count, join code
    - `NetworkPlayerIndicator` components for remote players
  - **Player Section** (may be hidden):
    - Shows local active players
    - Add player button (for local players only)

**Key Sub-Components:**
- `GameTitleMenu` - Menu for game options (setup, new game, quit)
- `GameModeIndicator` - Shows üéØ Solo, ‚öîÔ∏è Battle, üèÜ Tournament, üë• Select
- `RoomInfo` - Displays room metadata
- `NetworkPlayerIndicator` - Shows remote players with scores/streaks
- `ActivePlayersList` - List of selected players
- `AddPlayerButton` - Button to add more players with popover
- `FullscreenPlayerSelection` - Large player picker for fullscreen mode
- `PendingInvitations` - Banner for room invitations

**State Management:**
- Lifted from `PageWithNav` to preserve state across remounts:
  - `showPopover` / `setShowPopover` - AddPlayerButton popover state
  - `activeTab` / `setActiveTab` - 'add' or 'invite' tab selection

## 4. Navigation Flow

### Flow 1: Solo Player ‚Üí Game Selection ‚Üí Room Creation ‚Üí Game Start

```
/arcade (Champion Arena)
  ‚Üì [Select players - updates GameModeContext]
  ‚Üì [Click game card - GameCard.onClick ‚Üí router.push]
/arcade/room (if not in room, shows game selector)
  ‚Üì [Select game - calls setRoomGame mutation]
  ‚Üì [Room created, gameName saved to roomData]
  ‚Üì [useRoomData refetch updates roomData.gameName]
/arcade/room (now displays the game)
  ‚Üì [Game Provider and Component render]
```

### Flow 2: Multiplayer - Room Invitation

```
User A: Creates room via Champion Arena
User B: Receives invitation
User B: Joins room via /arcade/room
User B: Sees same game selection (if set) or game selector (if not set)
```

### Flow 3: Exit Game

```
/arcade/room (in-game)
  ‚Üì [Click "Quit" or "Exit Session" in GameContextNav]
  ‚Üì [onExitSession callback ‚Üí router.push('/arcade')]
/arcade (back to champion arena)
  ‚Üì Player selection reset by GameModeContext
```

## 5. Game Chooser / Game Selection System

**File:** `/Users/antialias/projects/soroban-abacus-flashcards/apps/web/src/components/GameSelector.tsx` (lines 1-112)

**How It Works:**
1. `GameSelector` component gets all games from both sources:
   - Legacy `GAMES_CONFIG` (currently empty)
   - Registry games via `getAllGames()`

2. For each game, creates `GameCard` component with configuration including `url` field

3. Game Cards rendered in 2-column grid (responsive)

4. When card clicked:
   - `GameCard` checks `activePlayerCount` against game's `maxPlayers`
   - If valid: calls `router.push(config.url)` - client-side navigation via Next.js
   - If invalid: blocks navigation with warning

**Two Game Systems:**

### Registry Games (NEW - Modular)
- Location: `/Users/antialias/projects/soroban-abacus-flashcards/apps/web/src/arcade-games/`
- File: `/Users/antialias/projects/soroban-abacus-flashcards/apps/web/src/lib/arcade/game-registry.ts`
- Examples: `complement-race`, `memory-quiz`, `matching`
- Each game has: `manifest` (metadata), `Provider` (context), `GameComponent` (UI)
- Games registered globally via `registerGame()` function

### Legacy Games (OLD)
- Location: Directly in `/app/arcade/` directory
- Examples: `/app/arcade/complement-race/page.tsx`
- Currently, only complement-race is partially migrated
- Direct URL structure: `/arcade/{gameName}/page.tsx`

**Game Config Structure (for display):**
```javascript
{
  name: string,              // Display name
  fullName?: string,         // Longer name for detailed view
  description: string,       // Short description
  longDescription?: string,  // Detailed description
  icon: emoji,              // Game icon emoji
  gradient: css gradient,   // Background gradient
  borderColor: css color,   // Border color for availability
  maxPlayers: number,       // Player limit for validation
  chips?: string[],         // Feature labels
  color?: 'green'|'purple'|'blue', // Color theme
  difficulty?: string,      // Difficulty level
  available: boolean,       // Is game available
}
```

## 8. Routing Summary

**Current URL Structure:**

```
/                          ‚Üí Home page (Soroban Generator)
/create                    ‚Üí Create flashcards
/guide                     ‚Üí Tutorial guide
/games                     ‚Üí Games library (external game pages)
/arcade                    ‚Üí Champion Arena (main landing with game selector)
/arcade/room               ‚Üí Active game display or game selection UI
/arcade/room?game={name}   ‚Üí Query param for game selection (optional)
/arcade/complement-race    ‚Üí OLD: Direct complement-race page (legacy)
/arcade/complement-race/practice  ‚Üí Complement-race practice mode
/arcade/complement-race/sprint    ‚Üí Complement-race sprint mode

/arcade/memory-quiz        ‚Üí Memory quiz game page (legacy structure)
```

**Query Parameters:**
- `/arcade/room?game={gameName}` - Optional game selection (parsed by GameCard)

## 9. Key Differences: /arcade vs /arcade/room

| Aspect | /arcade | /arcade/room |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| **Purpose** | Game selection hub | Active game display or selection within room |
| **Displays** | GameSelector with all games | Selected game OR game selector if no game in room |
| **Room Context** | Optional (can start solo) | Usually in a room (fetches via useRoomData) |
| **Navigation** | Click game ‚Üí /arcade/room | Click game ‚Üí Saves to room ‚Üí Displays game |
| **GameContextNav** | Shows player selector | Shows room info when joined |
| **Player State** | Local only | Local + remote (room members) |
| **Exit Button** | Usually hidden | Shows "Exit Session" to return to /arcade |
| **Socket Connection** | Optional | Always connected (in room) |
| **Page Transition** | User controls | Driven by room state updates |

## 10. Planning the Merge (/arcade/room ‚Üí /arcade)

**Challenges to Consider:**

1. **URL Consolidation:**
   - `/arcade/room` would become a sub-path or handled by `/arcade` with state
   - Query param `?game={name}` could drive game selection
   - Current: `/arcade/room?game=complement-race`
   - Could become: `/arcade?game=complement-race&mode=play`

2. **Route Disambiguation:**
   - `/arcade` needs to handle: game selection display, game display, game loading
   - Same page different modes based on state
   - Or: Sub-routes like `/arcade/select`, `/arcade/play`

3. **State Layering:**
   - Local game mode (solo player, GameModeContext)
   - Room state (multiplayer, useRoomData)
   - Both need to coexist

4. **Navigation Preservation:**
   - Currently: `GameCard` ‚Üí `router.push('/arcade/room?game=X')`
   - After merge: Would need new logic
   - Fullscreen state must persist (uses Next.js router, not reload)

5. **PageWithNav Behavior:**
   - Mini-nav shows game selection UI vs room info
   - Currently determined by `roomInfo` presence
   - After merge: Need same logic but one route

6. **Game Display:**
   - Currently: `/arcade/room` fetches game from registry
   - New: `/arcade` would need same game registry lookup
   - Game Provider/Component rendering must work identically

**Merge Strategy Options:**

### Option A: Single Route with Modes
```
/arcade
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Mode: browse (default, show GameSelector)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Mode: select (game selected, show GameSelector for confirmation)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Mode: play (in-game, show game display)
```

### Option B: Sub-routes
```
/arcade
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /arcade (selector)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /arcade/play (game display)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ /arcade/configure (player config)
```

### Option C: Query-Parameter Driven
```
/arcade
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /arcade (default - selector)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /arcade?game=X (game loading)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ /arcade?game=X&playing=true (in-game)
```

**Recommendation:** Option C (Query-driven) is closest to current architecture and requires minimal changes to existing logic.
