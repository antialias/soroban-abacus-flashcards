/**
 * Test to reproduce delivery thrashing bug
 *
 * The bug: When a car is at a station for multiple frames (50ms intervals),
 * the delivery logic fires repeatedly before the optimistic state update propagates.
 * This causes multiple DELIVER_PASSENGER moves to be sent to the server,
 * which rejects all but the first one.
