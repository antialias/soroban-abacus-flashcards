# Magnifier Zoom Refactoring Progress

## Overview
The MapRenderer.tsx component had grown to 2409 lines with significant code duplication and complex zoom logic. This refactoring aims to improve maintainability by extracting utilities and hooks.

## Completed Work

### Phase 1: Extract Pure Functions ✅

**Created utility modules:**

1. **`utils/screenPixelRatio.ts`**
   - `calculateScreenPixelRatio()` - Calculate screen pixel ratio from zoom context
   - `isAboveThreshold()` - Check if ratio exceeds threshold
   - `calculateMaxZoomAtThreshold()` - Calculate max zoom for capping
   - `createZoomContext()` - Helper to build context from DOM elements
   - **Impact**: Replaced 8 duplicated calculations across MapRenderer

2. **`utils/zoomCapping.ts`**
   - `capZoomAtThreshold()` - Cap zoom with metadata
   - `wouldZoomBeCapped()` - Simple capping check
   - **Impact**: Centralizes zoom capping logic with clear API

**Benefits achieved:**
- ✅ Eliminated significant code duplication
- ✅ Added comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Created testable pure functions
- ✅ All TypeScript passes with no new errors

### Phase 2: Extract Custom Hooks (In Progress)

**Created hooks:**

1. **`hooks/usePointerLock.ts`** ✅
   - Manages pointer lock state and events
   - Provides requestPointerLock() and exitPointerLock() methods
   - Includes onLockAcquired/onLockReleased callbacks
   - Automatic cleanup on unmount

2. **`hooks/useMagnifierZoom.ts`** ✅
   - Manages zoom state (targetZoom, uncappedAdaptiveZoomRef)
   - React Spring animation with configurable easing
   - Automatic pause/resume at precision mode threshold
   - Zoom capping when pointer lock state changes
   - Recalculation of capped zoom on pointer lock release
   - **Impact**: Replaces ~150 lines of zoom-related logic in MapRenderer

3. **`hooks/useRegionDetection.ts`** ✅
   - Detection box around cursor (configurable size)
   - Region overlap detection with bounding box checks
   - Region-under-cursor detection (closest to center)
   - Size tracking for adaptive behaviors
   - Small region detection (< 15px or < 200px² area)
   - Returns sorted DetectedRegion[] (smallest first)
   - **Impact**: Encapsulates ~100 lines of region detection logic

**Phase 2 Complete!** All planned hooks have been extracted.

## Remaining Work

### Phase 1 (Optional)
- Extract adaptive zoom search algorithm to `utils/adaptiveZoomSearch.ts`
  - **Note**: This is complex (~200 lines) and can be done separately

### Phase 2 ✅ Complete
No remaining work - all planned hooks extracted.

### Phase 3 (Partial Integration)

**Completed:**
- ✅ Integrated `findOptimalZoom()` utility (replaced ~220 lines)
- ✅ Reduced MapRenderer from 2430 → 2236 lines (-194 lines, -8%)
- ✅ Removed unused imports
- ✅ Algorithm now testable in isolation

**Remaining:**
- Integrate custom hooks (usePointerLock, useMagnifierZoom, useRegionDetection)
- **Challenge**: Hooks contain duplicate state management
- Further reduce to target ~500-800 lines

### Phase 4 ✅ Complete
- ✅ Created `MAGNIFIER_ARCHITECTURE.md` (343 lines)
- ✅ Documented core concepts (screen pixel ratio, zoom capping, precision mode)
- ✅ Documented system architecture and data flows
- ✅ Documented design decisions and trade-offs
- ✅ Added testing checklist and future improvements

## Key Learnings

1. **Screen Pixel Ratio** is the core metric (how many screen pixels the magnifier "jumps" per mouse pixel)
2. **Precision Mode Threshold** (20 px/px) determines when to recommend pointer lock
3. **Zoom Capping** prevents excessive sensitivity before precision mode activates
4. **Adaptive Zoom Search** finds optimal zoom based on detected region sizes

## Testing Strategy

- No behavior changes - purely structural refactors
- TypeScript catches interface issues
- Manual testing on dev server
- All code remains backward compatible

## Files Modified

### New Files Created
- `utils/screenPixelRatio.ts` (130 lines)
- `utils/zoomCapping.ts` (122 lines)
- `hooks/usePointerLock.ts` (119 lines)
- `hooks/useMagnifierZoom.ts` (240 lines)
- `hooks/useRegionDetection.ts` (238 lines)
- `MAGNIFIER_ARCHITECTURE.md` (343 lines)

### Modified Files
- `components/MapRenderer.tsx`
  - Replaced 8 duplicated screen pixel ratio calculations with utility calls
  - Replaced ~220 lines of adaptive zoom search with findOptimalZoom() call
  - Net reduction: 2430 → 2236 lines (-194 lines, -8%)

## Next Steps

When continuing:
1. Test current changes on dev server (hooks not yet integrated)
2. **Recommended**: Extract adaptive zoom search to utils (Phase 1 optional)
3. Phase 3: Integrate hooks into MapRenderer (requires hook adaptation)
4. Measure final line count reduction

**Integration Challenge**: The hooks were created in isolation and contain
duplicate state management. MapRenderer has its own zoom/pointer lock state
that needs to be unified with the hooks. Consider extracting adaptive zoom
search first as it's more self-contained.
